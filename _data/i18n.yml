    coc: Code of Conduct
    coc_intro: <h2>Short Version</h2>
      <p>UI/UX Conf China is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
      <h2>Long Version</h2>
      <h4>Harassment</h4>
      <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
      <h4>Exhibitors & Sponsors</h4>
      <p>Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
      <h4>Participants</h4>
      <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts/special badges. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.

    how_to_cyb: How to Convince your Boss
    cyb_p: You love design and want to be part of UI/UX Conf. Need some support to get here? Convince your boss that UI/UX Conf is a great investment for your design team. We did all the heavy lifting for you including stats, and a great email template. 
    cyb_p1: <p>You're staring at your screen right now. You might be at work, you might be lounging on your bed, you might be on the subway.</p><p>You are staring at your screen right now because you love design.</p><p>You live, breathe, and eat design and think the whole world should, too. Since you're staring at your screen, you're probably not talking with other designers at the moment; you probably haven't spoken to a designer outside of work in weeks. Let's do something about that.</p>
    cyb_p2: <p>It's time to unleash your creativity and your ideas. Meet and interact with 1000 designers in the flesh at UI/UX Conf in Shanghai this October. Learn about new trends, find people that agree with and that challenge your design philosophies, make lifelong friends that are also making the world a more well-designed place. </p><p>This two-day conference will have networking, talks by 20 top designers from all over the world, and workshops for you to grow personally and professionally as a designer. </p>
    cyb_p3: UI/UX Conf China was born from <a href='http://wiredcraft.com' target='new'>Wiredcraft</a>'s monthly <a href='http://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-UI-UX-Designers-Meetup/' target='new'>UIUX meetups in Shanghai</a>, which took off like wildfire. The meetups soon had waitlists longer than your arm and people were clamoring for more opportunities to hang out and network, so the folks at Wiredcraft put together this conference to unite all of these interested designers and design experts from around the world.
    cyb_p4: "<h2>Now the tricky part: covering your ticket and other expenses</h2><p>Good news, you can convince your boss. Going to conferences isn't just about individual growth; it can really help your team. Benefits for your company for attending UI/UX Conf:<br/><ol><li>You can find awesome designers, like yourself, to hire full-time or freelance</li><li>You will learn new design skills/techniques/inspiration during our talks</li><li>You'll be refreshed, motivated, and ready to get back to work and do great designing</li><li>Your company's name recognition and brand will be more widely known, thanks to this connected global design community</li><li>You'll have great stories to share with your team for inspiration and brainstorming</li><li>You can find new business leads for your company to pursue</li><li>You'll probably come back happier, healthier, less stressed, and more productive</li></ol></p>"
    cyb_p5: "<h2>Is UI/UX Conf China expensive?</h2><ul><li>IXDC in Beijing - 215 USD - 1500 RMB（Half day keynote speech）</li><li>Participatory Design Conference in Denmark - 670 USD / 4500 RMB</li><li>UX and Digital Design Week in London - 2600 USD / 17000 RMB</li><li>HybridConf in Berlin - 550 USD / 3700 RMB</li><li>UIST in Tokyo - 695 USD / 4600 RMB</li><li>Service Design Hong Kong - 500 USD / 3350 RMB</li><li>UX Australia - 880 USD / 6800 RMB</li></ul><p><h3>What's our price?</h3></p><p>Early bird: 68 USD / 450 RMB<br/>Group price (for 5+): 90 USD / 600 RMB<br/>Regular price: 120 USD / 800 RMB</p><p><h3>What you get in the price of the ticket - </h3></p><ul><li>2 day conference ticket</li><li>1 bag filled to the brim with premium swag</li><li>Raffle tickets to win 10 Sketch Licenses, educational books & design materials</li><li>Access to the after-party</li><li>Access to top-notch workshops</li><li>Lunch for two days</li></ul>"

    <div class='article'>Dear El Jefe, <br/><br/>
    <p>Design is our company's heart and soul. We know the importance that design makes in our everyday workflow and our products and how it's an ever-evolving field.  In support of our company's commitment to design, I think we should sponsor our team's attendance at UI/UX Conf China on October 15th-16th in Shanghai (<a href='http://2016.uiuxconf.com/' target='new'>http://2016.uiuxconf.com</a>).</p><p>UI/UX Conf is a nonprofit, community-driven conference that focuses on bringing together designers of all disciplines to share in knowledge and community. The conference was born from the UI/UX Designers Meetup in Shanghai and has the strong support of the design community.</p> <p>I believe our company would benefit from our designers' attendance for the following reasons:</p> <ol><li>This conference is a chance to hear from respected designers from all over the world, sharing what they do at their companies</li><li>We'll have the chance to interact with designers from companies like Google, Facebook, frog, Autodesk, Netflix, Mc Donald's, etc  to have success design processes</li><li>This is an opportunity to build a network for recruitment and generating leads</li><li>The price point is awesome - at 600RMB for group deal, it's a steal compared to other conferences in the Asia-Pacific region</li><li>The design team will come back inspired and will learn from the community, bringing back new ideas to the team</li><li>A trip to such an awesome conference will offer us a chance to relax and refresh and return ready to great work</li><li>We should take advantage of this great opportunity to meet designers in the greater Asian community. </li><li>We can take advantage of the early bird discount, or look into the group rates (5 or more at 600 RMB each) offered here. <a href='http://www.bagevent.com/event/156568' target='new'>http://www.bagevent.com/event/156568</a> </li></ol><p>Best Regards, <br/>Your Dazzling Designer</p></div></div>"
