Since you're staring at your screen, you're probably not talking with other designers at the moment; you probably haven't spoken to a designer outside of work in weeks. Let's do something about that.</p></div>

    <p>UI/UX Conf China was born from <a href="http://wiredcraft.com" target="new">Wiredcraft</a>'s monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-UI-UX-Designers-Meetup/" target="new">UIUX meetups in Shanghai</a>, which took off like wildfire. The meetups soon had waitlists longer than your arm and people were clamoring for more opportunities to hang out and network, so the folks at Wiredcraft put together this conference to unite all of these interested designers and design experts from around the world.</p>

    <div><h2>Email Template:</h2><p>We've made it easy. Here's a template to send to your boss:</p><div class="email"> <div class="hr"><strong>To:</strong> El Jefe [eljefe@mycompany.com]<br /> <strong>Subject:</strong>  UI/UX Conf China 2016 will benefit our design team<br /></div> <div class="article">Dear El Jefe, <br /><br /> <p>Design is our company's heart and soul. We know the importance that design makes in our everyday workflow and our products and how it's an ever-evolving field.  In support of our company's commitment to design, I think we should sponsor our team's attendance at UI/UX Conf China on October 15th-16th in Shanghai (<a href="http://2016.uiuxconf.com/" target="new">http://2016.uiuxconf.com</a>).</p><p>UI/UX Conf is a nonprofit, community-driven conference that focuses on bringing together designers of all disciplines to share in knowledge and community. The conference was born from the UI/UX Designers Meetup in Shanghai and has the strong support of the design community.</p> <p>I believe our company would benefit from our designers' attendance for the following reasons:</p> <ol><li>This conference is a chance to hear from respected designers from all over the world, sharing what they do at their companies</li><li>We'll have the chance to interact with designers from companies like Google, Facebook, frog, Autodesk, Netflix, Mc Donald's, etc  to have success design processes</li><li>This is an opportunity to build a network for recruitment and generating leads</li><li>The price point is awesome - at 600RMB for group deal, it's a steal compared to other conferences in the Asia-Pacific region</li><li>The design team will come back inspired and will learn from the community, bringing back new ideas to the team</li><li>A trip to such an awesome conference will offer us a chance to relax and refresh and return ready to great work</li><li>We should take advantage of this great opportunity to meet designers in the greater Asian community. </li><li>We can take advantage of the early bird discount, or look into the group rates (5 or more at 600 RMB each) offered here. <a href="http://www.bagevent.com/event/156568" target="new">http://www.bagevent.com/event/156568</a> </li></ol><p>Best Regards, <br />Your Dazzling Designer</p></div></div></div>
