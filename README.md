  ## Install

  We use both npm and bower, respectively for the gulp dependencies (+ eggshell) and 3rd party JS:

      npm install
      bower install

  You also may need to install the `githug-pages` gem:

      sudo gem install github-pages

  ## Build

  You'll need to build the JS and CSS:

      gulp

  ## Run

  It's a regular jekyll site:

      jekyll serve

  localhost:4000
